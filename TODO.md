# CORS and API Endpoint Fix - Progress Tracker

## ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

### 1. Fixed Netlify Function CORS Headers
- [x] Added consistent CORS headers to all responses
- [x] Created `corsHeaders` object for reusability
- [x] Added proper OPTIONS preflight handling
- [x] Added HTML email formatting for better readability

### 2. Fixed API URL Construction Logic
- [x] Corrected production URL to include `/api/send-email` path
- [x] Fixed local development URL to include `/api/send-email` path
- [x] Simplified fetch call to use the complete API URL

### 3. Created Environment Configuration
- [x] Created `.env.example` template file
- [x] Created `.env.production` reference file

## üîß Next Steps

### 1. Local Development Setup
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Edit `.env` and set your local API URL:
   ```
   VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:3001/api/send-email
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev:full
   ```

### 2. Production Deployment (Netlify)
1. Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard:
   - `GMAIL_USER`: Your Gmail address
   - `GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD`: Your Gmail app password

2. Deploy to Netlify - the contact form should now work correctly

### 3. Testing
- [ ] Test locally with `npm run dev:full`
- [ ] Test production deployment on Netlify
- [ ] Verify CORS headers are working
- [ ] Test email sending functionality

## üìù Notes

- The contact form now correctly handles both development and production environments
- CORS issues should be resolved with proper headers
- Email sending should work in both local and production environments
- Make sure to set up Gmail app password (not regular password) for email functionality
