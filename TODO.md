# Persistent View Counter Implementation

## Steps to Complete:

1. [x] Create a JSON file for storing view count data
2. [x] Add view count API endpoint to server/server.js
3. [x] Create Netlify function for view count API
4. [x] Update ViewCounter component to use the API
5. [x] Test the functionality locally
6. [x] Configure for production deployment

## Current Status:
- Implementation completed successfully
- Local development environment working:
  - GET /api/view-count - returns current view count ✅
  - POST /api/view-count - increments view count ✅
- Production-ready Netlify function created
- View counter now persists across sessions and automatically increments for each visitor

## Testing Results:
- Server health check: ✅ Working
- View count increment: ✅ Working (count: 111)
- View count retrieval: ✅ Working
- Local development: ✅ Fully functional
- Production configuration: ✅ Ready for deployment

## Deployment Instructions:
1. Deploy to Netlify
2. The view counter will automatically work on priyanshudas.netlify.app
